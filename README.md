## Requirements

- Android API level 21+ (Android 5.0 or higher)
- Kotlin 1.9.0+
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or higher

## Installation

Add the following to your root `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ... other repositories
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.testpress:tpstreams-android-player:1.0.0")
}
```

## Usage

1. Initialize the SDK (do this once, typically in your Application class):

```kotlin
TPStreamsPlayer.init("your_organization_id")
```

2. Create a player instance:

```kotlin
val player = TPStreamsPlayer.create(
    context = context,
    assetId = "your_asset_id",
    accessToken = "your_access_token",
    shouldAutoPlay = false // Optional, defaults to true
)
```

3. Use with Jetpack Compose:

```kotlin
AndroidView(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .aspectRatio(16 / 9f),
    factory = { context ->
        PlayerView(context).apply {
            this.player = player
            useController = true
        }
    }
)
```

4. Basic playback control:

```kotlin
// Start playback
player.play()

// Pause playback
player.pause()

// Release resources when done
player.release()
```
